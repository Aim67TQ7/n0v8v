# Company-Wide Intranet GPT Integration

## Overview

This project involves expanding the initial GPT-like interface to include multiple specialized GPT models tailored for different functions within the company, such as visual assistance, product support, and inspection training. By integrating these specialized GPTs, the intranet is transformed into a dynamic conversational hub that can handle specific queries with greater accuracy and relevance.

## Goals

### Primary Goal

- Enhance the intranetâ€™s functionality by integrating specialized GPTs to address specific operational needs.

### Secondary Goals

- Streamline workflows by providing precise information and training through conversational AI.

## Specialized GPT Integration

- **Visual Assistant GPT**: Handles queries related to visual data interpretation, such as reading diagrams or providing guided visual tours of products.
- **Product Assistance GPT**: Offers detailed product information, troubleshooting, and advice based on the latest product data.
- **Inspection Teaching GPT**: Provides step-by-step guidance for inspection processes and safety protocols.

## Technology Enhancements

- **AI Model Management**: Utilize a model management system to efficiently switch between different GPTs based on the context of the query.
- **Dynamic Loading**: Implement dynamic model loading to ensure that the system uses resources efficiently, loading only the necessary models based on user interaction.

## User Interface Adaptations

- **Contextual Interface Changes**: The UI adapts dynamically to the type of query, displaying relevant tools, and options.
- **Interactive Elements**: Incorporate interactive elements such as buttons or sliders to allow users to specify the nature of their queries more effectively.

## Backend Enhancements

- **API Gateway**: Use an API gateway to manage requests to different GPT models, ensuring smooth transitions and accurate request routing.
- **Data Integration**: Strengthen integration with internal databases and APIs to provide real-time data to the GPTs, enhancing response accuracy.

## Security and Compliance

- **Enhanced Authentication**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that employees can access only those resources pertinent to their roles.
- **Audit Trails**: Maintain comprehensive logs and audit trails to monitor the usage of the AI systems and ensure compliance with internal policies.

## Testing and Quality Assurance

- **Specialized Testing**: Conduct domain-specific testing for each GPT model to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Engage with end-users from each domain to validate the usefulness and usability of the system.

## Deployment and Scaling

- **Scalable Architecture**: Design the backend to scale different GPT models independently based on demand.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Consider deploying on a cloud platform that supports auto-scaling and dynamic resource allocation.

## Future Considerations

- **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly update the models based on new data and user feedback.
- **Expansion Potential**: Explore the addition of new specialized GPTs as new needs arise within the company.
